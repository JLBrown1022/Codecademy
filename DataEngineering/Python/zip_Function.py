# Combining Lists: The Zip Function called zip()
# The zip() function takes two or more lists and returns an iterator that 
# generates tuples of elements from the lists.
# The zip() function stops generating tuples when the shortest list is exhausted.

# function list()

# Use a list comprehension to create a new list with tuples of the elements
