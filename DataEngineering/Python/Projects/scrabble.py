#  Define a function called score_word that takes in 
#  a parameter word
def score_word(word):

  #5 create a for loop that goes through the letters 
  #  in word and adds the point value of each letter 
  #  to point_total by getting get the point value  
  #  from the letter_to_points dictionary. If a letter 
  #  is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the 
  #  point_total

#11 Iterate through the items in player_to_words. Call
#   each player player and each list of words words
#
#   Within your loop, create a variable called 
#   player_points and set it to 0.
for player, words in players_to_words.items():
  player_points = 0

  #12 Within the loop, create another loop that goes 
  #   through each word in words and adds the value 
  #   of score_word() with word as an input
  for word in words:
    player_points += score_word(word)
    print("+", player, word)
    
  print("*", player, player_points)

  #13 After the inner loop ends, set the current 
  #   player value to be a key of player_to_points, 
  #   with a value of player_points.
  player_to_points[player] = player_points

#14 player_to_points should now contain the mapping of 
#   players to how many points theyâ€™ve scored. Print this 
#   out
print(player_to_points)
